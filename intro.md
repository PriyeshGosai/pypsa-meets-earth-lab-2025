# Welcome to PyPSA Meets Earth Lab 2025

Welcome to the **PyPSA Meets Earth Lab 2025** course materials! This course provides hands-on training and practical examples for energy system modelling using PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis).

## About This Course

This course is designed to help you understand and work with PyPSA, a powerful open-source framework for simulating and optimizing modern power and energy systems. Through interactive lessons and examples, you'll learn how to:

- Build and analyze energy system models
- Work with network components (buses, generators, loads, lines, links)
- Import and export network data
- Optimize power system operations
- Visualize and interpret results

## Course Materials

The course includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that you can run in Google Colab or locally on your computer. Each lesson builds on previous concepts and includes practical examples.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)

You can run the notebooks directly in your browser using Google Colab. Click the rocket icon at the top of any lesson page and select "Colab" to get started. This requires a Google account but no local installation.

### Option 2: Local Installation

To run the notebooks locally:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PriyeshGosai/pypsa-meets-earth-lab-2025.git
   cd pypsa-meets-earth-lab-2025/lab-2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pypsa pandas plotly jupyter
   ```

   Using conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pypsa pandas plotly jupyterlab
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

## Course Contents

This course consists of multiple lessons covering different aspects of PyPSA:

- **Lesson 1: PyPSA Demystified** - Core concepts, best practices, and new features
- **Lesson 2: Advanced PyPSA** - More complex modeling scenarios

Each lesson includes:
- Conceptual explanations
- Code examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Visualization tools
